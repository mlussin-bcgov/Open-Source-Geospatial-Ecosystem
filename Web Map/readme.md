# Gitanyow Land Use Plan Open Source Web Application

The Gitanyow Land Use Plan (LUP) is an amalgamation of existing land use plans that overlap with the Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs Office (PIP). This project aims to provide an efficient way to spatially identify relevant non-legal and legal objectives. Additionally, the data needs to be compared against what is publicly accessible through the Gitanyow LUP website to ensure alignment.

## Deliverables

- An internal web application that consolidates all relevant data from British Columbia to compare against the public Gitanyow data (see the `data_source.xlsx` for details on layers).
- Display and query the SRMP/LRMP layers clipped to the Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs PIP boundary.
- Ability to add a KML, geomark, shapefile, or Area of Interest (AOI) as a temporary layer to the web map.
- Identify overlaps in the SRMP/LRMP data and potentially export the tabular data, similar to a mini status report.
- If possible, add links on the Skeena Data Hub to centralize all information in one location.
